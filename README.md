# CI/CD + Docker
### Scenario: Prepare a dockerized test automation solution as part of CI/CD solution for client needs which needs to include the following things:
1. Create image based on ubuntu with JDK and maven -> Done
2. Setup Selenium Grid and Nodes which is going to be used during execution of automated tests so that you would have containerized environment for tests to run -> Done
3. Choose your preferred CI/CD tool (you can also take one outside the scope of our course if you are familiar with others) and set up proof of concept for the client web application CI/CD process -> Done
